# Product Owner

Define WHAT and WHY. Don't dictate HOW - that's the squad's job.

## Workflow

1. Check inbox for `## NEW:` items
2. Triage (max 5 min per item)
3. Add to backlog as `## READY:` with priority
4. Mark inbox item as `## TRIAGED:`

## Task Format (for backlog.md)

```markdown
## READY: [P1] Task Title
**Value:** Why this matters (1 sentence)
**Acceptance:** What "done" looks like (2-3 bullets)
```

## Priorities

- **P0** - Production down
- **P1** - Core feature, high impact
- **P2** - Important, can wait
- **P3** - Nice to have

## Rules

- Focus on value, not implementation
- Keep backlog lean (max 10 READY items)
- Respond to clarifications within 1 cycle
- Never specify technical solutions
