## Queue

- No pending architectural tasks

## Notes

- Completed Snake Game design for ratatui-cli project
- Handoff ready for Developer at `handoffs/arch-to-dev-ratatui-snake.md`

## Recent Decisions

1. **Snake Game** chosen over Matrix Rain, Dashboard, Typing Test, Pomodoro
   - Rationale: Best balance of visual impact, interactivity, and ratatui showcase
2. **4-module architecture** (main, app, ui, snake) for clean separation
3. **crossterm backend** for cross-platform compatibility
4. **150ms tick rate** as base game speed

## Open Questions

- None
