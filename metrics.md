# DORA Metrics

Tracking the four key metrics that DORA research shows correlate with high-performing teams.

## Current Period

| Metric | Value | Target | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Deployment Frequency | -- | Daily | -- |
| Lead Time for Changes | -- | < 1 day | -- |
| Change Failure Rate | -- | < 15% | -- |
| Mean Time to Recovery | -- | < 1 hour | -- |

## Why These Metrics?

Based on 10+ years of research from DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA), analyzing 32,000+ professionals across industries:

- **Speed and stability are NOT tradeoffs** - Elite teams excel at both
- **High performers** have 208x more frequent deployments than low performers
- **Lead time** for elite teams is less than 1 day vs 6+ months for low performers

## Metric Definitions

### Deployment Frequency
How often code is deployed to production. Higher is better.
- **Elite:** On-demand (multiple times per day)
- **High:** Weekly to monthly
- **Medium:** Monthly to every 6 months
- **Low:** Less than once every 6 months

### Lead Time for Changes
Time from code commit to running in production.
- **Elite:** Less than 1 day
- **High:** 1 day to 1 week
- **Medium:** 1 week to 1 month
- **Low:** More than 6 months

### Change Failure Rate
Percentage of deployments causing production failures.
- **Elite:** 0-15%
- **High:** 16-30%
- **Medium:** 16-30%
- **Low:** 16-30%

### Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
Time to restore service after production incident.
- **Elite:** Less than 1 hour
- **High:** Less than 1 day
- **Medium:** 1 day to 1 week
- **Low:** More than 6 months
