# Backlog

Prioritized work for the squad. Devs claim directly - no dispatcher needed.

---

## How This Works

1. **PO** adds items as `## READY:`
2. **Devs** claim by changing to `## IN_PROGRESS: @dev-name`
3. **Devs** complete by changing to `## DONE: @dev-name`
4. **DevOps** deploys and changes to `## SHIPPED:`

No handoff chain. No waiting. Claim it, build it, ship it.

---

## Priority Guide

- **P0** - Production down, drop everything
- **P1** - Core feature, high impact
- **P2** - Important, can wait
- **P3** - Nice to have

---

## Ready for Work
<!-- Devs: claim these by adding @your-name and changing to IN_PROGRESS -->

---

## Done
<!-- Completed, waiting for deployment -->

---

## Shipped
<!-- Deployed to production -->
